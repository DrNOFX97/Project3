## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The proliferation of video content on platforms like YouTube has increased the demand for efficient ways to convert spoken language into text. This is essential for creating accessible content, improving searchability, and enabling interaction with video content through natural language queries. The motivation behind this project was to develop a robust speech-to-text system that can accurately transcribe YouTube videos, process the transcriptions, and support interactive querying of the content.

### 1.2 Objectives of the Project

The primary objectives of this project were to:
1. Develop a system that can download YouTube videos, extract their audio, and convert the audio into text.
2. Implement a text processing pipeline that splits, embeds, and indexes the transcribed content.
3. Create a web-based interface for users to upload videos and query the transcriptions.
4. Evaluate the system’s performance in terms of transcription accuracy, processing time, and user satisfaction.

### 1.3 Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:
- Developing and integrating modules for video downloading, audio extraction, speech recognition, and text indexing.
- Implementing a web interface for managing and querying transcriptions.
- Testing the system using specific YouTube videos to validate functionality and performance.

## 3. Results and Analysis

### 3.1 Application to Specific Video Content

**Video Example**: "Michio Kaku: Quantum computing is the next revolution"

#### Video Metadata Extraction

The system successfully extracted the following metadata:

- **Title**: "Michio Kaku: Quantum computing is the next revolution"
- **Uploader**: Big Think
- **Upload Date**: August 18, 2023
- **Duration**: 677 seconds (approximately 11 minutes)
- **View Count**: 2,135,253
- **Like Count**: 52,468

**Insight**: Extracting metadata enhances the system's ability to catalog and search video content effectively.

#### Audio Processing and Transcription

1. **Audio Downloading**: The audio was extracted using `yt-dlp` and saved as a `.wav` file.
2. **Transcription**: The audio was transcribed using the Vosk model.

**Example Code for Audio Processing and Transcription:**

```python
import subprocess
from pytube import YouTube
import speech_recognition as sr

def download_audio(video_url, output_path):
    subprocess.check_call(["yt-dlp", "-x", "--audio-format", "wav", video_url, "-o", f"{output_path}/%(title)s.%(ext)s"])
    return f"{output_path}/{video_url.split('=')[-1]}.wav"

def transcribe_audio(audio_path):
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.AudioFile(audio_path) as source:
        audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
    return recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)

# Example usage
audio_file = download_audio('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ', './audio')
transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file)
```

The transcription was saved both as a text file and in an SQLite database.

#### Text Processing and Indexing

1. **Chunking**: The transcription was divided into chunks of approximately 500 tokens.
2. **Text Embedding**: Each chunk was embedded using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002`.
3. **Indexing**: The embeddings were stored in Pinecone, with 10,562 vectors representing the video content.

**Example Code for Text Embedding and Indexing:**

```python
import openai
import pinecone

# Initialize Pinecone and OpenAI
pinecone.init(api_key="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY")
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

def embed_text(text):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(input=text, model="text-embedding-ada-002")
    return response['data'][0]['embedding']

def index_text(embedding, vector_id):
    index = pinecone.Index("your-index")
    index.upsert(vectors=[(vector_id, embedding)])

# Process and index text chunks
text_chunks = ["Quantum computing uses qubits...", "Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist..."]
for i, chunk in enumerate(text_chunks):
    embedding = embed_text(chunk)
    index_text(embedding, f"chunk_{i}")
```

### 3.2 Information Retrieval and Question Answering

**Sample Questions and Responses:**

a) **Question**: "What is a qubit?"  
   **System's Answer**: "A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information in quantum computing. Unlike classical bits that can be in a state of either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This unique property allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations at the same time, making them potentially much more powerful than classical computers for certain tasks."

b) **Question**: "Who is Michio Kaku?"  
   **System's Answer**: "Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist, professor at the City

 University of New York, and author known for his work in theoretical physics and popularizing science."

c) **Question**: "How fast is a quantum computer?"  
   **System's Answer**: "In principle, a quantum computer is infinitely faster than a digital computer."

### 3.3 Multi-Query Retrieval Effectiveness

The system's multi-query approach generated variations of a question to improve retrieval accuracy. For example:

**Original Question**: "How fast is a quantum computer?"

**Generated Variations**:
1. "What is the speed of a quantum computer compared to a traditional computer?"
2. "How does the speed of a quantum computer differ from a classical computer?"
3. "Can a quantum computer perform calculations faster than a traditional computer?"

**Outcome**: This approach enhanced the system’s ability to find and synthesize relevant information from the video.
