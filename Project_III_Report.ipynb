    "b) **Question**: \"Who is Michio Kaku?\"  \n",
    "   **System's Answer**: \"Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist, professor at the City University of New York, and author known for his work in theoretical physics and popularizing science.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "c) **Question**: \"How fast is a quantum computer?\"  \n",
    "   **System's Answer**: \"In principle, a quantum computer is infinitely faster than a digital computer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight**: The system effectively captured key points and general knowledge, demonstrating its capacity to integrate detailed content with broader context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Multi-Query Retrieval Effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "For the query \"How fast is a quantum computer?\", the system handled variations such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"What is the speed of a quantum computer compared to a traditional computer?\"\n",
    "2. \"How does the speed of a quantum computer differ from a classical computer?\"\n",
    "3. \"Can a quantum computer perform calculations faster than a traditional computer?\"\n",
